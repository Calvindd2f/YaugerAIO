System Monitoring
Disk Space Check:
Displays the free and used space on your main drive (C:), helping you keep track of available storage.

CPU Usage:
Monitors and reports the current CPU load so you can gauge system performance.

RAM Usage:
Shows how much memory is being used versus what is available, aiding in performance troubleshooting.

Cleanup & Optimization
DNS Cache Flush:

Browser Cache Clearing:
Automatically clears the cache for popular browsers – including Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera, and Firefox – to free up space and improve performance.

Disk Cleanup (Optional):
Optionally invokes Windows Disk Cleanup to remove temporary files and unnecessary data.

System Maintenance
DISM Scan:
Runs a DISM (Deployment Image Servicing and Management) scan to check and repair the Windows system image, ensuring system health.

SFC Scan:
Executes an SFC (System File Checker) scan to detect and fix corrupted system files.

Improved Output: The scan now consistently ends with “Scanning ...” (three dots) to match the DISM scan display.

Windows Updates
Update Module Installation:
Installs and configures the PSWindowsUpdate module if it’s not already available on your system.

Update Check & Install:
Checks for available Windows updates and installs them automatically.

Restart Prompt Refinement:
The restart prompt is now shown at the end of the script—after all tasks (including logging) have completed—to avoid interrupting any processes midway.

Logging & Reporting
Detailed Log File:
Every action, from system checks to updates, is logged. A detailed log file is created on your Desktop, allowing you to review all operations after the script completes.

Accurate Runtime Reporting:
The total runtime now correctly includes the duration of Windows updates, providing a true measure of the script’s execution time.

Visual & Functional Enhancements
Intuitive Color Coding:
Enhanced color coding for process outputs makes it easier to identify different types of messages.

Expanded Browser Support:
Support has been added for clearing caches in Brave, Opera, and Firefox in addition to Chrome and Edge.

Save Space Calculation Fix:
The calculation for space freed now correctly prevents negative values that could occur during repeated tests.

Revamped ASCII Banner:
The ASCII banner has been updated for a more engaging and fun introduction.

Browser Cache Warning:
A reminder is included to close all browsers before cache clearing to ensure the process runs effectively.
